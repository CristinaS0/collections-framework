# Context:

This project was completed as part of the Full-Stack Programming Course to gain a more comprehensive understanding of Collections and Exceptions. It was developed through pair-programming in collaboration with @PedroRocha84.
The main objective was to explore Data Structures such as custom implementations of List, Set, and Queue, ensuring they follow the expected behaviors of these collections. Additionally, the project emphasized the use of Ant, a Java library, for build processes.

# Achievements

- Practice implementing custom collections from scratch.

- Understand the internal workings of Lists, Sets, and Queues.

- Write efficient and optimized code.

- Improve your understanding of interfaces and their usage.

# Tech Stack
